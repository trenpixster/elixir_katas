__File parsing and code refactoring__

##Part One

In weather.dat you’ll find daily weather data for Morristown, NJ for June 2002. Write a program to output the day number (column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature is the second column, the minimum the third column).

##Part Two

The file football.dat contains the results from the English Premier League for 2001/2. The columns labeled `F` and `A` contain the total number of goals scored for and against each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

##Part Three

Take the two programs written previously and factor out as much common code as possible, leaving you with two smaller programs and some kind of shared functionality.

- To what extent did the design decisions you made when writing the original programs make it easier or harder to factor out common code?

- Was the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?

- Is factoring out as much common code as possible always a good thing? Did the readability of the programs suffer because of this requirement? How about the maintainability?
